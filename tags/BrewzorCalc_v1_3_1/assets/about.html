<h2>About Brewzor Brewing Calculator</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>The goal of this application is to provide a set of tools a
person could actually use during their brew day. It has been released
under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL v3</a> open
source license. For more information, visit our website at <a

<h3>Calculators Included in Brewzor:</h3>

<p><b>Gravity Correction:</b> What do you do when you miss your
pre-boil gravity? Not correcting gravity before adding your hops can
affect the hop utilization and perceived bitterness of your beer. If
your gravity is too low, the calculator will tell you how much extract
to add to your kettle to bring the gravity up to your pre-boil level. If
the gravity is too high, the calculator will tell you how much water to
add to dilute your wort to the desired pre-boil gravity.</p>

<p><b>Cylinder Volume / Cylinder Height:</b> Accurately measuring
volume can be difficult. Since my kettle has a flat bottom and is round
(a cylinder), I can use a calibrated stick (like a yard stick or a
marked wooden dowel) to measure the liquid height and the diameter of my
kettle, making it easy to calculate the volume.</p>

<p><b>Strike Temperature:</b> Used to determine the temperature of
your initial mash strike water for a given amount of grain and a given
amount of strike water.</p>

<p><b>Mash Infusion:</b> Computes the amount of water needed to raise mash the temperature.</p>

<p><b>Decoction Volume:</b> Computes the decoction volume needed to raise the mash temperature.</p>

<p><b>Batch Sparge:</b> Computes the amount of water to add to the
mash for batch sparging. Adjusts volume for grain absorption.</p>

<p><b>Boil Off:</b> Helps determine evaporation and cooling loss for
a boil.</p>

<p><b>Carbonation:</b>Calculates the required priming sugar (bottle
conditioning) or PSI (kegging) required to carbonate a given volume of
beer to a number of volumes of CO2.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol / Attenuation:</b>Calculates the ABV%, ABW%, Apparent Attenuation, and Real Attenuation</p>

<p><b>Refractometer:</b>Several calculations for determing gravity when using a refractometer.</p>

<p><b>Hydrometer Correction:</b> Don't feel like cooling your sample
down to 60F to take a gravity measurement? This calculator determines
the corrected gravity for a sample based on the temperature.</p>

<p><b>Unit Converters:</b> Converters for gravity, mass, volume,
distance and temperature are included.</p>

<h3>I found a bug - what do I do?</h3>

<p>Bug reports should be emailed to <a
	href="mailto:bugs@brewzor.com">bugs@brewzor.com</a>. If the bug
resulted in the application crashing, a crash report is optionally sent
the next time the application is started.</p>

<h3>I have an idea for a new feature!</h3>

<p>Requests for additional functionality should be emailed to <a
	href="mailto:features@brewzor.com">features@brewzor.com</a>.</p>


<h3>Why is this free?</h3>

<p>I really enjoy homebrewing as a hobby and would love the
opportunity to give back to the community. I think something like this
will only help people make better beer. That's never a bad thing.</p>
