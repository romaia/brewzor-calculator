<h2>Brewzor Pro versus Brewzor Calculator:</h2>

<p>Brewzor Calculator is a subset of the features found in Brewzor Pro.  Both applications are free, but some users don't need a fully functional recipe and brew manager.  For those people, Brewzor Calculator provides the same brewing calculators in Brewzor Pro, but in a smaller installed file size.</p>

<a name="mainmenu"></a>
<h2>Main Menu</h2>

<p>Long tapping the Recipe Manager menu item displays a dialog for exporting or deleting all recipes in the database.</p>

<a name="newrecipe"></a>
<h3>New Recipe:</h3>

<p>Click this menu option to create a new recipe.  Saves are handled automatically once you have entered a recipe name.</p>

<a name="recipemanager"></a>
<h3>Recipe Manager:</h3>

<p>This is a list of all the recipes in the recipe database.  You may import additional recipes by clicking Menu and then clicking Import.</p>

<p>If there are no recipes in the database, you will be presented with a button allowing you to import the default recipes via the internet or from BeerXML files stored on your phone.</p>

<p><img src="images/recipe_list.png" /></p>

<p>After importing records, you might see a lock icon next to your recipe name.  This indicates that Brewzor is using the values from your imported data instead of computing them itself.  When you see a lock icon, you are only allowed to change certain aspects of a recipe - basically things that don't affect the IBU, SRM, gravity, etc.  To make these items editable, change the Preference: Recipe Calculations to "Calculate gravity, color, and IBU"</p>

<p>When available, Brewzor will try and display the recipe name, SRC/EBC (colored bar on the left), OG, IBU, and style.</p>

<p>Clicking on a recipe from the list will take you to the recipe detail screen for that particular recipe.  Long tapping on a recipe in the list will present a menu for editing, exporting or deleting the recipe.</p>

<a name="recipedetail"></a>
<h3>Recipe Detail:</h3>

<p>The recipe detail screen lets you edit a recipe.  A recipe name, efficiency, boil time, and equipment are all required before OG, color and IBU calculations can be performed.</p>

<p>If the Preference: Recipe Calculations is set to "Use imported values for gravity, color and IBU calculations", a lock icon will appear next to all uneditable items.</p>

<a name="calculators"></a>
<h2>Calculators Included in Brewzor:</h2>

<a name="hopbitterness"></a>
<h3>Hop Bitterness Calculator:</h3>

<p>The hop bitterness calculator lets you create a hop schedule for determining an estimate of IBUs.</p>

<p>Before IBUs can be calculated, several things about the brew need to be defined.  Enter a boil volume, batch volume (the volume that goes into the fermenter) and the wort gravity.  You may optionally change the bitterness formula.  Now click the plus icon to add a hop charge.  You will be presented with the hop addition dialog.  Enter the information about your hop charge and click Add.</p>

<p>Based on formulas found <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/hops/FAQ.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Great-Beers-Ultimate-Brewing/dp/0937381500">here</a>.</p>

<a name="hopalphacorrection"></a>
<h3>Hop Alpha Correction Calculator:</h3>

<p>You've formulated your recipe and now that you're at the homebrew store, you see that their hops are a different alpha acid percent than your recipe calls for.  This calculator helps you figure out how much of the new hop you need to maintain the same bitterness in your final beer.</p>

<p>Based on formulas found <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/hops/FAQ.html">here</a>.</p>

<a name="yeastpitchingrate"></a>
<h3>Yeast Pitching Rate Calculator:</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to improve your beer is through pitching the proper amount of yeast.  Most calculators only provide a single step for propagating yeast.  Unfortunately, not all of us have the ability to make large starters.  That's where stepping up starters comes in.  You can create more yeast but repeating your starter step more than once.</p>

<p>To use the calculator, first select the type of beer you're making (Ale or Lager).  Then select your yeast format (Liquid or Dry).  Enter the Original Gravity and Wort Volume.  Your yeast should have a date of manufacture stamped on it - enter that value in production date.  Enter the number of vials/packs you want to start with.  And finally select Basic Starter (no agitation) or Stir Plate (agitation).</p>

<p>Once the above information has been entered, it is time to create a starter.  Click the Add Starter button.  A new starter will appear.  Move the slider until the Total Cells Grown amoutn turns green.  If you can't grow enough cells in one step (or the starter size is greater than your flask), click Step Up to create another starter step.  You can now adjust both sliders until your Total Cells Grown matches Cells Needed.</p>

<p>Based on formulas found <a href="http://www.maltosefalcons.com/tech/yeast-propagation-and-maintenance-principles-and-practices">here</a> and <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/republicbrewpub/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although Brewzor is not affiliated with the site, I have found <a href="http://www.brewershardware.com/home.php">Brewer's Hardware</a> provides an affordable home stir plate solution.</p>

<a name="gravitycorrection"></a>
<h3>Gravity Correction:</h3>

<p>What do you do when you miss your pre-boil gravity? Not
correcting gravity before adding your hops can affect the hop
utilization and perceived bitterness of your beer. If your gravity is
too low, the calculator will tell you how much dried malt extract <acronym title="Dried Malt Extract">(DME)</acronym>
or liquid malt extract <acronym title="Liquid Malt Extract">(LME)</acronym> to add to your kettle to raise the gravity
to your pre-boil level. If the gravity is too high, the calculator will
tell you how much water to add to dilute your wort to the desired
pre-boil level.</p>

<p>To use the gravity calculator, enter the current gravity, desired
gravity and wort volume values into the fields provided. Dilution or
concentration instructions are automatically calculated and will appear
below the entry fields.</p>

<p>The formulas used to calculate the gravity corrections were based on information found <a href="http://www.brewboard.com/index.php?showtopic=31009">here</a>.</p>

<p class="formula">
Extract PG for LME = 44<br />
Extract PG for DME = 36<br />
<br />
Amount of DME = (GU<sub>target</sub> - GU<sub>mash</sub>) / 36<br />
Amount of LME = (GU<sub>target</sub> - GU<sub>mash</sub>) / 44<br />
Water for dilution = (GU<sub>mash</sub> / GU<sub>target</sub>) - Volume<sub>pre-dilution</sub><br />
</p>

<a name="kettlevolume"></a>
<h3>Kettle Volume Calculators:</h3>

<p>Accurately measuring volume during a brew session can be
difficult. Since most kettles have a flat bottom and are round (a
cylinder), you can use a calibrated stick (like a yard stick or a marked
wooden dowel) to measure the liquid height and the diameter of my
kettle, making it easy to calculate the volume in the kettle.</p>

<p>The formula used for volume is:<br />
<span class="formula"> Volume = Pi * (Diameter /
2) <sup>2</sup> * Height </span></p>

<p>The formula used for height is: <br />
<span class="formula"> Height = Volume / Pi *
(Diameter / 2) <sup>2</sup> </span></p>

<p>Enter the measured height or desired volume,
the kettle diameter and false bottom height. If you do not have a false
bottom, enter a zero. Values for heat expansion / cooling loss may also be entered.
The calculated volume or height will display below the entry
fields once all required data has been entered.</p>

<a name="striketemperature"></a>
<h3>Strike Temperature:</h3>

<p>Used to determine the temperature of your initial mash strike
water for a given amount of grain and a given amount of strike water.
The sparge water temperature will appear below the entry fields once all
data has been entered.</p>

<p>There are three modes for determining the amount of liquid to add to the mash.  Selecting Strike Water Volume lets you enter a fixed amount of water to the mash and the Infusion Temperature and water/grain ratio are calculated to match that value.  Selecting Infusion Temperature lets you pick the temperature of your strike water and the amount of water needed and water/grain ratio are calculated to match your temperature.  Selecting Water/Grain ratio lets you enter a ratio like 1.25 quarts water / 1 pound of grain or .3125 gallons of water / 1 pound of grain.
</p>

<p>The formulas used to determine strike temperature were based on information found <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Infusion_mashing">here</a> and <a href="http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue5.4/palmer_sb.html">here</a>.</p>

<p class="formula">
<b>T<sub>s</sub></b> = strike water temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>T<sub>t</sub></b> = target mash temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>T<sub>g</sub></b> = dry grain temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>R</b> = Water to grain ration in quarts per pound (usually around 1 - 1.25)<br />

<p class="formula">
T<sub>s</sub> = (0.2 / R) X (T<sub>t</sub> - T<sub>g</sub>) + T<sub>t</sub></p>
</p>

<a name="mashinfusion"></a>
<h3>Mash Infusion:</h3>

<p>Calculates the amount of water needed to raise the temperature of the mash a given number of degrees.  This currently does not account for heat loss to the mash tun.  This means, you might need to adjust the result based on your system.</p>

</p>

<a name="decoctionvolume"></a>
<h3>Decoction Volume:</h3>

<p>Calculates the decoction volume needed to raise the temperature of the mash a given number of degrees.  This currently does not account for heat loss to the mash tun.  This means, you might need to adjust the result based on your system.</p>

<p>Formulas used were based on information found <a href="http://www.feathercraft.net/decoction/">here</a>.</p>

<p class="formula">
<acronym title="Decoction Volume"> D<sub>v</sub></acronym> = The volume you need to take from the mash to perform the decoction in quarts<br />
<acronym title="Target Mash Temperature"> T<sub>mt</sub></acronym> = Target temperature of the mash<br />

<acronym title="Infusion Water Temperature"> I<sub>wt</sub></acronym> = Temperature of the infusion water. Defaults to boiling (212&deg;F/100&deg;C)
</p>

<p class="formula">
DecoctionVolume = (T<sub>mt</sub> - I<sub>mt</sub>) * (G<sub>w</sub> * (0.3125 + (W<sub>im</sub> / G<sub>w</sub>))) / (I<sub>wt</sub> - I<sub>mt</sub>)</p>


<p><b>Additional Settings: </b></p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>The temperature of the decoction is defined in Preferences :: Equipment :: Boiling Temperature.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="batchsparge"></a>
<h3>Batch Sparge:</h3>

<p>Batch sparging is a great way to save time at the expense of a
little efficiency. It has been determined that the best extraction
efficiency is obtained by having equal run-off volumes. That said, the
resulting thinner mash would change the mash chemistry. It is
recommended that you mash at a "normal" water to grain ratio (1-1.25
quarts / pound of grain) and then add sparge water to the mash tun to
bring it up to the suggested water to grain ratio accounting for water
loss due to grain absorption</p>

<p>The amount of water in the mash may be entered either as a ratio of water to grain or as volume.  You may use up to 3 separate batch sparges by selecting a new value for Number of Sparges.</p>

<p>Once your sparge parameters have been entered, the volume for each sparge is displayed along with the total batch sparge water needed.</p>

<p>The formulas are based on information found <a href="http://www.franklinbrew.org/brewinfo/nbsparge.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The formulas used to calculate batch sparge volumes are (volume units can be anything as long as they are the
same throughout):</p>

<p class="formula">
WaterToGrainRatio = User entered<br />
GrainAbsorptionRatio = .13<br />
StrikeWaterVolume = WaterToGrainRatio * GrainWeight<br />
GrainAbsorptionVolume = GrainAbsorptionRatio * GrainWeight<br />
FirstSpargeVolume = (BoilVolume / 2) - (StrikeWaterVolume - GrainAbsorptionVolume)<br />
SecondSpargeVolume = BoilVolume / 2
</p>

<a name="boiloff"></a>
<h3>Boil Off:</h3>

<p>Helps determine evaporation and cooling loss for a boil. Enter
the starting volume, evaporation rate, boil time in minutes and the
cooling loss percentage.</p>

<p>Water loss due to evaporation may be entered one of three ways.  Evaporation Percent per Hour calculates water loss by reducing the volume by a percentage based on the length of the boil.  Fixed Evaporation Volume is a fixed amount of loss.  Evaporation Volume Per Hour is used if you know that you lose a specific amount every hour.</p>

<p><b>Additional Settings</b> :</p>
<ul>
   <li>Boil minutes is usually 60 - 90 minutes.</li>
   <li>Cooling Loss is usually 3% for mash temperatures and 4%
   for boiling.</li>
</ul>

<a name="alcoholattenuation"></a>
<h3>Alcohol / Attenuation:</h3>

<p>This calculator is used to determine the amount of alcohol by
weight and by volume in addition to the real and apparent attenuation.</p>

<p>Enter the original gravity and the current gravity and the calculator will display the ABV, ABW, AA and RA.  If you have selected Specific Gravity as your unit, you may also enter the sample temperature.  When this is entered, it will save you from having to use the Hydrometer Correction Calculator if your sample isn't at your calibratino temperature.  The Original Gravity is not adjusted for temperature.</p>

<p>The formulas used were based on information found <a href="http://www.pointbrewsupply.com/pdf/BeerAlcoholCalories.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p class="formula">Real Extract = 0.1808 * ºP(initial) + 0.8192 * ºP(final)</p>
<p class="formula">Apparent Attenuation = 1 - [ºP(final) / ºP(initial)] </p>
<p class="formula">Real Attenuation = 1 - [RealExtract / ºP(initial)] </p>
<p class="formula">ABV% = (OG - FG) / 0.75 </p>
<p class="formula">ABW% = (0.79 * ABV%) / FinalGravity</p>

<a name="refractometer"></a>
<h3>Refractometer:</h3>

<p><b>Note About Brix: I wasn't able to find a definitive
definition of Brix. It seemed to boil down to one of two things. Either
it is a refinement of the Balling system that uses a slightly different
modulus than Plato and thus produces very similar results. Or, Brix is a
"corrected" version of Plato used with refractometers. Generally there
is a correction factor that is applied to the refractometer reading (in
Brix) that will then give you a reading in Plato. I chose to do a
combination of both. The Brix Gravity Unit applies the correction factor
throughout the application when necessary. This means you can measure
your mash gravity in Brix and it other results will be automatically
adjusted.</b></p>

<p>Formulas were based on information found <a href="http://www.basicbrewing.com/radio/xls/BrixPlatoSG.xls">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Refractometer Calculator is broken into for sub-calculators:</p>

<p><b>Unfermented Wort:</b> This is used to determine the Specific Gravity of wort when measured by a refractometer.  The correction factor is used to account for non-sucrose elements in the wort.</p>
<p><b>Fermenting Wort:</b> This calculator is used to determine the Corrected Specific Gravity of wort that has begun fermentation.</p>
<p><b>Finished Beer:</b> This calculator can find the Original Gravity of a beer after a refractometer reading and a hydrometer reading.</p>
<p><b>Calibrate:</b>This calculator helps you determine the proper correction factor.  Take a reading with your refractometer and hydrometer and enter the values into the calculator.  If you would like to set the global conversion factor to your new value, just click the "Save Correction Factor to Preferences" button.</p>

This is used to determine the Specific Gravity of wort when measured by a refractometer.  The correction factor is used to account for non-sucrose elements in the wort.
<a name="carbonation"></a>
<h3>Carbonation:</h3>

<p>Calculates the required priming sugar (bottle conditioning) or
pressure (kegging) required to carbonate a given volume of beer to a number
of volumes of CO2.</p>

<p class="warning"> WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!</p>

<p class="warning">This calculator is meant as a guide only. Using the incorrect amount of
priming sugar can cause bottles to explode and is extremely dangerous.
If the amount recommended by the calculator seems wrong, it probably is.
You should take all necessary steps to ensure you don't over-carbonate
your beer as that may result in extreme bodily harm, death and/or bad beer.</p>

<p class="warning">WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!</p>

<p>The formula for setting the regulator to the correct pressure in
pounds per square inch for the desired level of carbonation was taken
from the BYO article found
<a href="http://www.byo.com/stories/techniques/article/indices/39-kegging/165-balancing-your-draft-system-advanced-brewing">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="formula">

<a name="hydrometercorrection"></a>
<h3>Hydrometer Correction:</h3>

<p>Don't feel like cooling your sample down to 60F to take a gravity
measurement? This calculator determines the corrected gravity for a
sample based on the temperature. Enter the reading from your hydrometer and
the temperature of your sample. The result will be displayed below the
entry fields once the data has been entered.</p>

<p>The value for the hydrometer calibration temperature is set in Preferences: Hydrometer Calibration Temperature.</p>

<p>The formula used to determine temperature correction for hydrometer was based on information found <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f13/temp-correction-formula-hydrometer-10684/index2.html">here</a> and <a href="http://hbd.org/brewery/library/HydromCorr0992.html">here</a>.</p>

<p class="formula">
<b>SG<sub>c</sub></b> = corrected SG of the sample <br />
<b>SG<sub>m</sub></b> = measured SG of the sample <br />
<b>T<sub>m</sub></b> = Temperature in &deg;F of the sample<br />
<b>T<sub>c</sub></b> = Calibration temperature of your hydrometer - usually 60&deg;F or 68&deg;F<br />

<p class="formula">
SG<sub>c</sub> = SG<sub>m</sub> * ( 
             (
               1.00130346 - 
               1.34722124e-4 * T<sub>m</sub> + 
               2.04052596e-6 * T<sub>m</sub><sup>2</sup> - 
               2.32820948e-9 * T<sub>m</sub><sup>3</sup>
             ) 
             / 
             (
               1.00130346 - 
               1.34722124e-4 * T<sub>c</sub> + 
               2.04052596e-6 * T<sub>c</sub><sup>2</sup> - 
               2.32820948e-9 * T<sub>c</sub><sup>3</sup>
             )

<h3>Unit Converters:</h3>

<p>Converters for gravity, mass, volume and temperature are
included. They aren't meant to include every measurement and are mostly
included for convenience.</p>

<p>The formulas used to convert between <acronym title="Specific Gravity">SG</acronym> and Plato are based on information found <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/spencer/attenuation.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Formula used to convert Specific Gravity to Plato: </p>
<p class="formula"> P = (668.72 * SG) - 463.37 - (205.347 * SG <sup>2</sup> )</p>

<p>Formula used to convert Plato to Specific Gravity: </p>
<p class="formula"> SG = ((0.082636 + (3.8480 * P) + (0.014563 * P <sup>2</sup> ))) / 1000) + 1</p>

<p>Formula used to convert Specific Gravity to Gravity Units: </p>
<p class="formula">GU = (SG - 1) * 1000</p>

<p><b>Boiling Temperature: </b>In case you live at altitude and your water doesn't boil it 100&deg;C</p>

<p><b>Hydrometer Calibration: </b>  The temperature to which your hydrometer is calibrated.  Usually 60 or 68&deg;F (15 - 20 &deg;C).</p>

<p><b>Refractometer Calibration: </b>I wasn't able to find a definitive
definition of Brix. It seemed to boil down to one of two things. Either
it is a refinement of the Balling system that uses a slightly different
modulus than Plato and thus produces very similar results. Or, Brix is a
"corrected" version of Plato used with refractometers. Generally there
is a correction factor that is applied to the refractometer reading (in
Brix) that will then give you a reading in Plato. I chose to do a
combination of both. The Brix Gravity Unit applies the correction factor
throughout the application when necessary. This means you can measure
your mash gravity in Brix and it other results will be automatically
adjusted.</b></p>

<p><b>First Wort Hop Utilization:</b> The percent utilization for first wort hops as compared to pellet hops added to a normal boil.</p>

<p><b>Mash Hop Utilization:</b> The percent utilization for mash hops as compared to pellet hops added to a normal boil.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p><b>Recipe Calculations: </b> Differences in how things like hop bitterness are be calculated from application to another, prompted this preference.  When set to "Use imported values...", Brewzor will use all values imported via BeerXML instead of calculating them internally.  When set to "Calculate gravity, color and IBU", Brewzor will calculate these values when possible.</p>

<p><b>Screen Dimming: </b> When set to "The screen will dim normally", your phone's screen might dim or turn off while you're using Brewzor.  If you would like to keep the screen on while using Brewzor, change this preference to "The screen will stay on."  When keeping the screen on, your phone's battery usage will increase.</p>

<p><b>Database Info: </b> Shows a record count for all tables and allows you to empty the database.</p>

<p><b>Restore Default Settings: </b>Returns all settings to their initial values.</p>
