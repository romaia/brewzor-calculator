<h2>Calculators Included in Brewzor Brewing Calculator:</h2>

<a name="gravitycorrection"></a>
<h3>Gravity Correction:</h3>

<p>What do you do when you miss your pre-boil gravity? Not
correcting gravity before adding your hops can affect the hop
utilization and perceived bitterness of your beer. If your gravity is
too low, the calculator will tell you how much dried malt extract (DME)
or liquid malt extract (LME) to add to your kettle to raise the gravity
to your pre-boil level. If the gravity is too high, the calculator will
tell you how much water to add to dilute your wort to the desired
pre-boil level.</p>

<p>To use the gravity calculator, enter the current gravity, desired
gravity and wort volume values into the fields provided. Dilution or
concentration instructions are automatically calculated and will appear
below the entry fields.</p>

<p>The formulas used to calculate the gravity corrections were based on information found <a href="http://www.brewboard.com/index.php?showtopic=31009">here</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>Extract PG for LME = 44</b><br />
<b>Extract PG for DME = 36</b><br />
<br />
<b>Amount of DME = (GU<sub>target</sub> - GU<sub>mash</sub>) / 36</b><br />
<b>Amount of LME = (GU<sub>target</sub> - GU<sub>mash</sub>) / 44</b><br />
<b>Water for dilution = (GU<sub>mash</sub> / GU<sub>target</sub>) - Volume<sub>pre-dilution</sub></b><br />
</p>

<a name="cylindervolumeheight"></a>
<h3>Cylinder Volume / Cylinder Height Calculators:</h3>

<p>Accurately measuring volume during a brew session can be
difficult. Since most kettles have a flat bottom and are round (a
cylinder), you can use a calibrated stick (like a yard stick or a marked
wooden dowel) to measure the liquid height and the diameter of my
kettle, making it easy to calculate the volume in the kettle.</p>

<p>The formula used for volume is: <b> Volume = Pi * (Diameter /
2) <sup>2</sup> * Height </b></p>

<p>The formula used for height is: <b> Height = Volume / Pi *
(Diameter / 2) <sup>2</sup> </b></p>

<p>Use the Cylinder Volume Calculator if you know the wort height
and would like to know the wort volume. Enter the measured height,
kettle diameter and your false bottom height. If you do not have a false
bottom, enter a zero. The calculated volume will display below the entry
fields once all data has been entered.</p>

<p>Use the Cylinder Height Calculator if you know the wort volume
and would like to know the wort height. Enter the desired volume, kettle
diameter and your false bottom height. If you do not have a false
bottom, enter a zero. The calculated height will display below the entry
fields once all data has been entered.</p>

<p><b>Additional Settings</b> :</p>
<ul>
	<li>The values for kettle diameter and false bottom height can be
	defined via the Settings screen.</li>
	<li>If "Correct for heat expansion" is selected in preferences, a
	button will be displayed above the result. Clicking the button will
	either no nothing or add /subtract the value defined in Cooling Loss
	Percentage preference (usually 4%).</li>
</ul>

<a name="striketemperature"></a>
<h3>Strike Temperature:</h3>

<p>Used to determine the temperature of your initial mash strike
water for a given amount of grain and a given amount of strike water.
The sparge water temperature will appear below the entry fields once all
data has been entered.</p>

<p>The formulas used to determine strike temperature were based on information found <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Infusion_mashing">here</a> and <a href="http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue5.4/palmer_sb.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>

<b>T<sub>strike</sub></b> = strike water temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>T<sub>target</sub></b> = target mash temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>T<sub>grain</sub></b> = dry grain temperature in &deg;F<br />
<b>R</b> = Water to grain ration in quarts per pound (usually around 1 - 1.25)<br />
<br />
<b>T<sub>strike</sub> = (0.2 ÷ R) X (T<sub>target</sub> - T<sub>grain</sub>) + T<sub>target</sub></b></p>

<p><b>Additional Settings</b> :</p>
<ul>
	<li>The setting Water to Grain Ratio will automatically calculate
	the sparge water volume. This is usually between 1-2 quarts / pound or
	its equivalent of you choose other units. When this value is greater
	than zero, the Sparge Water entry field in the calculator is disabled
	since the volume is calculated automatically.</li>
</ul>

<a name="mashinfusion"></a>
<h3>Mash Infusion:</h3>

<p>Calculates the amount of water needed to raise the temperature of the mash a given number of degrees.  This currently does not account for heat loss to the mash tun.  This means, you might need to adjust the result based on your system.</p>

</ul>

</p>

<a name="decoctionvolume"></a>
<h3>Decoction Volume:</h3>

<p>Calculates the decoction volume needed to raise the temperature of the mash a given number of degrees.  This currently does not account for heat loss to the mash tun.  This means, you might need to adjust the result based on your system.</p>

<p>Formulas used were based on information found <a href="http://www.feathercraft.net/decoction/">here</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>TargetMashTemperature = Target temperature of the mash</b><br />
<b>InitialMashTemperature = Initial temperature of the mash</b><br />

<b>DecoctionVolume = The volume you need to take from the mash to perform the decoction in quarts</b><br />
</p>

<p><b>DecoctionVolume = (TargetMashTemperature - InitialMashTemperature) * (GrainWeight * (0.3125 + (WaterInMash / GrainWeight))) / (InfusionWaterTemperature - InitialMashTemperature)</b></p>

</ul>

</p>

<a name="batchsparge"></a>
<h3>Batch Sparge:</h3>

<p>Batch sparging is a great way to save time at the expense of a
little efficiency. It has been determined that the best extraction
efficiency is obtained by having equal run-off volumes. That said, the
resulting thinner mash would change the mash chemistry. It is
recommended that you mash at a "normal" water to grain ratio (1-1.25
quarts / pound of grain) and then add sparge water to the mash tun to
bring it up to the suggested water to grain ratio accounting for water
loss due to grain absorption</p>

<p>The formulas are based on information found <a href="http://www.franklinbrew.org/brewinfo/nbsparge.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The formulas used to calculate batch sparge volumes are (volume units can be anything as long as they are the
same throughout):</p>

<p>
<b>WaterToGrainRatio = .31 gallons/pound (or whatever you've set in preferences)</b><br />
<b>GrainAbsorptionRatio = .13 (or whatever you've set in preferences)</b><br /> 
<b>StrikeWaterVolume = WaterToGrainRatio * GrainWeight</b><br />
<b>GrainAbsorptionVolume = GrainAbsorptionRatio * GrainWeight</b><br />
<b>FirstSpargeVolume = (BoilVolume / 2) - (StrikeWaterVolume - GrainAbsorptionVolume)</b><br />
<b>SecondSpargeVolume = BoilVolume / 2</b>
</p>

<p><b>Preferences:</b></p>

<p><b>Water To Grain Ratio:</b> Defines the thickness of your mash. Usually in the
range of 1 - 1.25 quarts per pound (.25 - .31 gallons / pound). </p>

<p><b>Grain Absorption Ratio</b> The amount of water lost due to absorption by the
grain. Generally about 1 pint per pound of grain (.13 gallons / pound).</p>

<a name="boiloff"></a>
<h3>Boil Off:</h3>

<p>Helps determine evaporation and cooling loss for a boil. Enter
the starting volume, evaporation rate, boil time in minutes and the
cooling loss percentage.</p>

<p><b>Additional Settings</b> :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Boil minutes is usually 60 - 90 minutes.</li>
	<li>Evaporation Rate is usually 3% for mash temperatures and 4%
	for boiling.</li>
	<li>Cooling Loss the percent loss per hour for your kettle. This
	is usually in the range of 5-15%. If you are in doubt, start with a
	value of 10%.</li>
</ul>

<a name="alcoholattenuation"></a>
<h3>Alcohol / Attenuation:</h3>

<p>This calculator is used to determine the amount of alcohol by
weight and by volume in addition to the real and apparent attenuation.</p>

<p>The formulas used were based on information found <a href="http://www.pointbrewsupply.com/pdf/BeerAlcoholCalories.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Real Extract = 0.1808 * ºP(initial) + 0.8192 * ºP(final)</b></p>
<p><b>Apparent Attenuation = 1 - [ºP(final) / ºP(initial)] </b></p>
<p><b>Real Attenuation = 1 - [RealExtract / ºP(initial)] </b></p>
<p><b>ABV% = (OG - FG) / 0.75 </b></p>
<p><b>ABW% = (0.79 * ABV%) / FinalGravity</b></p>

<a name="refractometer"></a>
<h3>Refractometer:</h3>

<p><b>Note About Brix: I wasn't able to find a definitive
definition of Brix. It seemed to boil down to one of two things. Either
it is a refinement of the Balling system that uses a slightly different
modulus than Plato and thus produces very similar results. Or, Brix is a
"corrected" version of Plato used with refractometers. Generally there
is a correction factor that is applied to the refractometer reading (in
Brix) that will then give you a reading in Plato. I chose to do a
combination of both. The Brix Gravity Unit applies the correction factor
throughout the application when necessary. This means you can measure
your mash gravity in Brix and it other results will be automatically
adjusted.</b></p>

<p>The Refractometer Calculator is broken into for sub-calculators:</p>

<p><b>Unfermented Wort:</b> This is used to determine the Specific Gravity of wort when measured by a refractometer.  The correction factor is used to account for non-sucrose elements in the wort.</p>
<p><b>Fermenting Wort:</b> This calculator is used to determine the Corrected Specific Gravity of wort that has begun fermentation.</p>
<p><b>Finished Beer:</b> This calculator can find the Original Gravity of a beer after a refractometer reading and a hydrometer reading.</p>
<p><b>Calibrate:</b>This calculator helps you determine the proper correction factor.  Take a reading with your refractometer and hydrometer and enter the values into the calculator.  If you would like to set the global conversion factor to your new value, just click the "Save Correction Factor to Preferences" button.</p>

This is used to determine the Specific Gravity of wort when measured by a refractometer.  The correction factor is used to account for non-sucrose elements in the wort.
<a name="carbonation"></a>
<h3>Carbonation:</h3>

<p>Calculates the required priming sugar (bottle conditioning) or
pressure (kegging) required to carbonate a given volume of beer to a number
of volumes of CO2.</p>

<p><b> WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! <br />
<br />

This calculator is meant as a guide only. Using the incorrect amount of
priming sugar can cause bottles to explode and is extremely dangerous.
If the amount recommended by the calculator seems wrong, it probably is.
You should take all necessary steps to ensure you don't over-carbonate
your beer as that can result in extreme bodily harm, death and
definitely bad beer. <br />
<br />

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! </b>
</p>
<p>The formula for setting the regulator to the correct pressure in
pounds per square inch for the desired level of carbonation was taken
from the BYO article found

<h3>Hydrometer Correction:</h3>

<p>Don't feel like cooling your sample down to 60F to take a gravity
measurement? This calculator determines the corrected gravity for a
sample based on the temperature. This calculator works for hydrometers
that are calibrated to 60F. Enter the reading from your hydrometer and
the temperature of your sample. The result will be displayed below the
entry fields once the data has been entered.</p>

<h3>General Settings</h3>

<p><b>Global Unit Change: </b>Makes it easy to toggle all preferences between US or metric units.</p>

<p><b>Temperature: </b>This is the unit used globally for
temperature. Possibilities include Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C).</p>

<p><b>Gravity: </b>This is the unit used globally for gravity.
Possibilities include Specific Gravity (SG), Gravity Units or Points
(GU), and Plato (P)</p>

<p><b>Pressure: </b>The unit of measurement used for pressure.  Possibilities include pounds per square inch (psi), kilopascals (kPa), bars (bar), and atmospheres (atm).</p>

<p><b>DME / LME Weight: </b>The unit of measurement used for extract
weight.</p>

<p><b>Correct for Heat Expansion: </b>When checked, the volumes
presented will be adjusted for heat expansion or cooling loss when
appropriate. The calculator will also display the expansion / loss
volume on the screen when it is being used.</p>

<p><b>Cooling Loss Percentage: </b>When at mash temperatures, wort
will expand about 3%. When boiling, the expansion is about 4%.</p>

<a name="prefsbatch"></a>

<h3>Batch Settings</h3>

<p><b>Batch Volume Units: </b>This is the unit used for batch
volume. Possibilities include Quart, Gallon, and Liter.</p>

<p><b>Final Batch Volume: </b>This is the unit used for final
volume, or the volume that goes into the fermenter. Possibilities
include Quart, Gallon, and Liter.</p>

<p><b>Grain Weight Units: </b>This is the unit used for grain
weight. Possibilities include Gram, Kilogram, Ounces, and Pounds.</p>

<p><b>Water to Grain Ratio: </b>This number represents the ratio of
water to grain based on the batch units above. Normally, this is
equivalent to .25-.31 gallons / pound OR 1-1.25 quarts / pound.</p>

<p>This describes the thickness of your mash. If this value is set,
the Strike Water calculator will use this value to calculate the amount
of strike water you need based on your entered value for grain weight.
The value is generally in the range of 1 - 2 quarts per pound. For
example if your ratio is 1.25 quarts per pound, you would enter "1.25"
into the entry field. Assuming a grain weight of 10 pounds, a total of
12.5 quarts would be used. When this value is greater than zero, the
entry field is disabled.</p>

<p><b>Boil Minutes: </b>The duration of the boil in minutes.
Normally, this is 60 - 90 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Mash Infusion Water Temperature: </b>The temperature of the water or decoction that gets added to the mash.  Defaults to boiling.</p>

<a name="prefsequipment"></a>
<h3>Equipment Settings</h3>

<p><b>Kettle Diameter / Height Units: </b>This is the unit used for
distance / length. Possibilities include Inches and Centimeters.</p>

<p><b>Kettle Diameter: </b>The diameter of the kettle. This is used
in the cylinder volume / height calculators.</p>

<p><b>False Bottom Height: </b>If you have a false bottom and are
measuring wort height, the value of wort below the false bottom needs to
be accounted for. Enter the height of your false bottom in Distance
Units. If you don't have a false bottom, just enter a zero.</p>

<p><b>Total Equipment Loss: </b>Total of the losses in your system (mash tun deadspace, trub, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Evaporation Rate: </b>The amount of loss over a 60 minute
period expressed as a percent of the kettle volume. This value is
generally between 5% and 15%. If you do not know the evaporation rate
for your kettle, start with 10%.</p>

<p>To determine the evaporation rate for your kettle:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Once at a boil, measure the starting volume as accurately as
	possible</li>
	<li>Maintain a <b>consistent</b> boil for 60 minutes</li>
	<li>While still boiling, measure the ending volume as accurately
	as possible</li>
	<li>Boil Loss % = (Ending Volume / 100) * Starting Volume</li>
	<li>Do this over the course of several brews and adjust as
	necessary. The key to generating accurate results is maintaining a
	consistent boil each time.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Hydrometer Calibration: </b>  The temperature to which your hydrometer is calibrated.  Usually 60 or 68&deg;F (15 - 20 &deg;C).</p>
